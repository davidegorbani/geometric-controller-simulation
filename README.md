# geometric-controller-simulation

This repository contains scripts written in Python that simulate a quadrotor.

Three control strategies are implemented in the scripts.

In the geom_cont_Johnson.py the geometric controller proposed in [1] is developed, in geom_cont_Lee.py the controller proposed by [3] is developed and in decoupled_controller_sim.py the controller proposed by [2] is developed.
